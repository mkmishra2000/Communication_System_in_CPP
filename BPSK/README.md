# BPSK
### (Binary Phase Shift Keying)
## All information
All information about the theory and this scheme implementation are present in [BPSK_ESD18I011.pdf](https://github.com/mkmishra2000/Modulation_Schemes_in_CPP/blob/main/BPSK/BPSK_ESD18I011.pdf)

## Final output plot
Final output is the comparison of simulated results to the calculated error results.
