# Modulation_Schemes_in_CPP
These repository contains BPSK, BFSK, QPSK, MPSK, (4,8,16)-QAM, hamming distance based decoder and syndrome based decoder in cpp. For plotting the BER vs SNR plot use gnuplot.

## Why this repositary exist?

C++ is faster and efficient than matlab and python. Many a times, students uses python and MATLAB for analysis of communication systems. Without knowing what is going on inside the black box (a inbuilt function). In this repository, a try has been made to design every thing from scratch. 

Through this repo, anybody can understand all basic communication system analysis and algorithms in c++. It requires only fundamentals of communication system design as prerequisite. 

I personally believe that this repo will be help for c++ lover and communication engineers as well as students. Any further optimazation and improvement is highly appreciable. Any addition of new algorithms and techniques are weclome.
